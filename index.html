    Craic fam. I'm David and I'm a designer from Belfast, Northern Ireland.

  <h2>Work</h2>
  <p>
    I'm self employed and trade as Invisible Building. <br />
    I design, code, strategise, build and grow brands. With continuous study and
    natural intuition, I specialise in design for the web and my core source of
    income is through selling web to local business, creatives and fellow
    entrepreneurs.

  <h2>Hiatus</h2>
  <p>
    In 2016 Invisible Building took a three year hiatus when I studyed the art
    of Email Marketing, working nearly 38.5 hours a week as an Email Developer
    for a company that sent 7 batch and blash emails a week to a customer base
    of nearly 2,000,000.
