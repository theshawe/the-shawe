    As mentioned on my home-page I'm self employed and trade as Invisible
    Building. I design, code, strategise, build and grow brands. With continuous
    study and natural intuition, I specialise in design for the web and my core
    source of income is through selling web to local business, creatives and
    fellow entrepreneurs.

    In 2016 I started working for my largest client, a Northern Irish startup
    steeped in history, after six months contracting with
    <a href="crc.html">Chain Reaction Cycles</a> I was offered a full time
    permanent contract working with the company as their Email Development
    Executive. I took this job and continued to work there until April 2019.

    Between 2016 and 2019 I continued to trade as Invisible Building. However I
    put the business on a three year Hiatus while I focused my energy on Email
    Development, Personalisation and Automation for CRC.
