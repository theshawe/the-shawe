<h2>Brave New World</h2>
<p class="meta">28 Mar 2015</p>

<div class="post">
<p>Reading this, you&#39;ll know I&#39;ve started a blog, I&#39;m pretty happy with myself. It&#39;s about time I&#39;ve started to write online. This post was scheduled for 28th of March 2015, but instead it&#39;s going out on the 28th April 2015. If I have an aim for May it is to post more regularly.</p>

<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212; I&#39;m going talk about how this site is built, why it&#39;s not finished  and the technology used to make it. </p>

<h2>Starting with Jekyll</h2>

<p>I decided to use <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> as the backbone for this website. This was so I could have the experience of running a blog with the help from Jekyll. If you&#39;re new to the word. Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator. This means that you build your Jekyll sites with HTML/CSS, write your blog posts in Markdown and host your site without having to connect to a database. The main benefit to this is speed. I&#39;ll write a more detailed post in the future about the positives and negatives of Static Sites Vs Dynamic Sites (future link here).  </p>

<h2>Moving On</h2>

<p>I wanted to build the site with the help of <a href="http://yeoman.io">Yeoman</a> and <a href="http://gulpjs.com">Gulp</a>. If you are new to these words, check them out. Again I&#39;ll talk about the these two words in more detail in a future post. But for now all you need to know is they are cool new tools that I had never used before and just decided I wanted to improve my work flow by utlising them. So I did!</p>

<p>If I am honest the main reason I wanted to build a blog with Jekyll was because you can write your posts in Markdown.</p>

<h2>Markdown</h2>

<p>If you do not know what markdown is, look it up. Markdown is an easy to read / easy to write language that converts your text into HTML and other formats. If you&#39;ve used message boards or content management systems that allow you to convert your text to bold using asterisks the chances are you&#39;ve used Markdown. It was created by John Gruber in 2004. To learn more about Markdown <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">read this</a>.</p>

<h2>The Summary</h2>

<p>So I didn&#39;t talk about much in this post except to say about things I&#39;m going to blog about in the future but I guess that&#39;s all I really wanted to blog about today anyway. I mentioned that the site was built with Jekyll, Yeoman, Gulp and with blog posts written in Markdown. Lastly I want to mention that this site is 100% a work in progress and I guess my posts are a work in progress too. </p>

<p>I want to write more, to learn more about writing. I want to blog often and continually tweak/improve the design of this website. I believe that the content should shape the design of the site and I&#39;m looking forward to watch this site grow, move and change as the content does.</p>

<p>I guess the moral of this story is to always finish up, to learn new tools and to put yourself out there even if it&#39;s not 100% complete.</p>

<p>Cheers</p>

<p>DJS</p>
